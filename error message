when using two public in a main java it show 
The public type sto must be defined in its own fileJava(16777541)
That means you can not use two public class outer in one java file

If .java file contains top level (not nested) public class, it has
to have the same name as that public class. So if you have class like
public class A{...} it needs to be placed in A.java file. Because of that we can't have two public classes in one .java file.
